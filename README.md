# Hard Stop & Momentary Stop Detection In Vehicles 

<br>

# Overview:

This repository contains the code and reports for the project titled "Hard Stop & Momentary Stop Detection In Vehicles." The project aims to analyze vehicle trajectories at signalized junctions and distinguish between different stop conditions such as "Momentary" and "Hard" stops, along with identifying continuous moving vehicles.
